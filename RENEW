2. Updating an expired token

If you have a token that you have been using and it expires you can run the command git remote -v. This command shows you your current origin which will look like;
https://[PERSONALACCESSTOKEN]@github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO].git.
There are two steps to update a expired token;

    First, you have to remove the expired token by running the command git remote remove origin.

    After removing the expired token you can run the command git remote -v to confirm that your token has been removed.

    You now need to generate a new token following the steps highlighted in the creating a new token.

    After creating a new token you need a to add a remote with your updated Github personal access token.

    You can add it using the command git remote add origin + your new generated token as follows; git remote add origin https://[PERSONALACCESSTOKEN]@github.com/[USERNAME]/[REPO].git and you are done.
